# **Who Im I ?**
My name is Mohamamd Abu taimeh.Im 29 years old,Graduated from Al Balqa Applied University with Software Engineering Bachelor's degree.
<br>

Im a **football player** 😎 i was playing in local club Called Al Yarmouk Club, i played with them until i got to university but i continued to play with friends and family.

Football in our family is most of our time, so if we are not playing football, we are watching it🤩.
 
Also i love food, if I go back in time and didn't study software engineering for sure i'll study to be a **Chef**😋.
## ***Why I Join LTUC ?***
I didn't care about my university studies after I graduated in 2017. As our professors told us, your university studies will give you 50% or less of the information that you will need in your practical life..It seems that I forgot that 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ Until I worked for the Arabian Romanian Electromechanical Contracting Company as a **Technical Support**. I had a lot to learn and they gave me time for that, and I continued to learn, at any time I had the opportunity to learn new methods or information, I took advantage of it as well. When I had the opportunity at LTUC to take a QA Testing course to learn in this field and specialize in it, I did not hesitate to do so. Due to its great reputation with good teachers, a suitable environment for learning, and modern methods of learning, it was the best place to learning and And gaining new knowledge, and here I am with you😊💪🏻💪🏻.<br><br>
# **The Fundamentals Of A Good Developer**
<br>

>## " Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer ".
<br>

As i read an article to Huseyin Polat Yuruk at [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-fundamentals-of-a-good-developer-mindset-in-15-minutes-81321ab8a682/)
to be a good developer you have to take care about some points will mention  them below.<br>

### 1. You must have purpose for the software.
( first purpose should be To **help** people ).<br>

### 2. Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others.<br>

### 3. Fully understand what are you doing.<br>

### 4.  Creates things that are easy to understand.<br>

### 5.  Don't expand your software purpose for no reason.<br>

### 6.  Thinking about future maintenance of changes must be one of your main responsibilities.<br>

### 7.  If you do something one way in one place, do it that way in every place.<br>

### 8.  Prioritize your work.<br>

### 9.  Solving Problems. 
( Do it by understanding well the problem then think what you will do, if its big problem divide it into smaller tasks and solve each sub-problem one by one ).
### 10.  Start small project, improve it, then extend.<br> 

### 11.  Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.<br>

### 12.  Assumption can kill a software project.<br>

### 13.  Don’t reinvent the wheel.<br>

### 14.  Always resist adding more code, more features until you are convinced that they are required.<br>

### 15.  Don’t spend your time on repetitive tasks.<br>

### 16.  Don't  measure software quality based on code lines.
(A small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.)
### 17.  You should add logging in a very early stage.
( This will help you to find the problem easily and save your time ).
### 18.  Refactoring should be the first option.<br>

### 19.  It is important to have documentation to explain your software’s architecture and every module and components.<br>

### 20.  Don't depend much on external technologies.<br>

### 21.  Don't depend much on external technologies.<br>

### 22.  Don’t be obsessive. Know when to quit. Don’t hesitate to ask for help.<br>

<br>
